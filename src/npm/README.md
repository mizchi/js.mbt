## NPM Library bindings

In near future, we split these bindings into a separate package.

- `mizchi/js/npm/react`
  - npm `react`
  - `mizchi/js/npm/react/element`
    - Typed HTML elements binding for Moonbit + React`
- `mizchi/js/npm/react_dom`
  - npm `react-dom`
- `mizchi/js/npm/react_router`
  - npm: `react-router`
  - Only `BrowserRouter` related api
- `mizchi/js/npm/react_testing_library`
  - npm: `@testing-library/react`
