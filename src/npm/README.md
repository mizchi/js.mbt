## NPM Library bindings

In near future, we split these bindings into a separate package.

- `mizchi/js/npm/react`
  - npm `react`
  - `mizchi/js/npm/react/element`
    - Typed HTML elements binding for Moonbit + React`
- `mizchi/js/npm/react_dom_client`
  - npm `react-dom/client`
- `mizchi/js/npm/react_dom_server`
  - npm `react-dom/server`
- `mizchi/js/npm/react_router`
  - npm: `react-router`
  - Only `BrowserRouter` related api
